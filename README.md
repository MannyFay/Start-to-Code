# Start to Code
Ready made environments to start with coding without configuration hell.  
It is made for beginners, so they can focus on writing and learning a specific programming language and for people who just want to play around with technology.

# License
This project has a MIT License, which means you can use it however you like.

# Recommendations
We highly recommend using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and an editor/IDE that provides auto-save every time a file has changed.  
Installation guides for Docker Desktop (you can control it with your terminal too) are [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

# Environments
The environments will grow. If there are needs for an environment, create issues.
